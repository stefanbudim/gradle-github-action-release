# Create a new release
Tag your commit with a version number that matches `v1.0.0`
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

Once the tag is pushed, the `Create Release` workflow will automatically trigger.
A new release will be created in the "Releases" tab of your repository, containing the generated JAR file as an asset.
